# Frictionless PHP Development

Seamlessly run and switch between different versions of PHP, with different installed extensions, thanks to the power of containers.

Take the advantage of goodies commands like `phpctl create` to start a new project, `phpctl repl` to start a REPL, `phpctl init` to initialize a new configuration file **and a lot more**.

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
wget -q https://phpctl.dev/phpctl-installer.sh && \
bash phpctl-installer.sh && rm phpctl-installer.sh
```
